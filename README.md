# Machine Learning: Final Project

 Implemented extensions to 3 machine learning algorithms learned in class, and compared their performance to similar ones in the Scikit-learn library.

- Lasso Regression
- Nearest Centroid
- Multi-class Gaussian SVM Kernel

Performance is compared by testing the 2 versions of the algorithm on the same datasets, and evaluating which one had better accuracy.

Each folder contains 2 jupyter notebook files, one for the extension and one for the sci-kit implementation, and a pdf report showing the results and explaining their differences.

The datasets used are provided in the Scikit-learn library.
